# Rule Reviewer MCP Server

An open source MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides intelligent rule review capabilities for development projects. It integrates with Cursor and other AI coding assistants to analyze and review both user-defined rules and project-specific rules.

## Features

- **üîç Comprehensive Rule Analysis**: Analyzes rule quality, conflicts, and gaps
- **üîÑ Duplicate Detection**: Identifies redundant rules, including those that duplicate Cursor's built-in capabilities
- **üìä Conflict Resolution**: Detects and provides recommendations for conflicting rules
- **üìù Multi-format Support**: Handles rules in Markdown, JSON, YAML, and plain text formats
- **üöÄ High Performance**: Efficient processing of large rule sets with concurrent analysis
- **üîå MCP Protocol Compliance**: Full MCP v1.0 protocol implementation for seamless integration

## Installation

### Quick Install (Mac)

- Git

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huahuayu/rule-reviewer-mcp.git
cd rule-reviewer-mcp
go mod download
go build -o rule-reviewer-mcp
```

### Cross-platform Builds

```bash
# Linux
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o rule-reviewer-mcp-linux

```

## Usage

### Running the MCP Server

The server operates in stdin/stdout mode for MCP protocol communication:

```bash
./rule-reviewer-mcp
```

### Integration with Cursor

Add the following to your Cursor MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rule-reviewer": {
      "command": "/path/to/rule-reviewer-mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Using the Rule Review Tool

Once configured, you can use the `review_rules` tool in Cursor:

```javascript
// Example tool call
{
  "name": "review_rules",
  "arguments": {
    "user_rules": "# My Rules\n- Use camelCase for variables\n- Always handle errors",
    "project_rules": "# Project Rules\n- Follow Go conventions\n- Use gofmt",
    "project_context": "Go web API project using fiber framework"
  }
}
```

## Rule Formats

### Markdown Format

```markdown
# Code Style Rules

## Variable Naming
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for types and structs

## Error Handling
- Always handle errors explicitly
- Use custom error types for business logic
```

### JSON Format

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Variable Naming",
    "content": "Use camelCase for variables and functions",
    "category": "code_style",
    "priority": "high"
  },
  {
    "title": "Error Handling",
    "content": "Always handle errors explicitly",
    "category": "error_handling",
    "priority": "high"
  }
]
```

### YAML Format

```yaml
variable_naming:
  category: code_style
  priority: high
  content: Use camelCase for variables and functions

error_handling:
  category: error_handling
  priority: high
  content: Always handle errors explicitly
```

### Plain Text Format

```text
Use camelCase for variables and functions
Always handle errors explicitly
Keep functions under 50 lines
Use descriptive function names
```

## Analysis Output

The rule review analysis includes:

### Executive Summary
A brief overview of the rule set health and key findings.

### Critical Issues
High-priority issues that require immediate attention.

### Conflicts Detected
Detailed list of conflicting rules with resolution recommendations.

### Duplicate Rules Found
- Rules that duplicate Cursor's built-in capabilities
- Inter-rule duplicates with consolidation recommendations

### Missing Rules (Gap Analysis)
Suggested new rules organized by category:
- Code style and formatting
- Architecture and design patterns
- Testing requirements
- Documentation standards
- Security practices
- Performance considerations
- Error handling
- Code review process
- Deployment and CI/CD

### Improvement Opportunities
Medium and low priority enhancements.

### Recommended Actions
Prioritized list of next steps.
