# Rule Reviewer MCP Server

An open source MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides intelligent rule review capabilities for development projects. It integrates with Cursor and other AI coding assistants to analyze and review both user-defined rules and project-specific rules.

## Features

- **🔍 Comprehensive Rule Analysis**: Analyzes rule quality, conflicts, and gaps
- **🔄 Duplicate Detection**: Identifies redundant rules, including those that duplicate Cursor's built-in capabilities
- **📊 Conflict Resolution**: Detects and provides recommendations for conflicting rules
- **📝 Multi-format Support**: Handles rules in Markdown, JSON, YAML, and plain text formats
- **🚀 High Performance**: Efficient processing of large rule sets with concurrent analysis
- **🔌 MCP Protocol Compliance**: Full MCP v1.0 protocol implementation for seamless integration
