# Rule Reviewer MCP Server

An open source MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides intelligent rule review capabilities for development projects. It integrates with Cursor and other AI coding assistants to analyze and review both user-defined rules and project-specific rules.

## Features

- **üîç Comprehensive Rule Analysis**: Analyzes rule quality, conflicts, and gaps
- **üîÑ Duplicate Detection**: Identifies redundant rules, including those that duplicate Cursor's built-in capabilities
